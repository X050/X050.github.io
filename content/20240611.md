Yesterday, I started working on a Linux-based OS that boots directly into the browser. Currently, the project uses a modified version of the EmacsOS script to boot into Firefox kiosk mode. The browser automatically opens windows93.net to masquerade as a real operating system.

What are the plans for the future?

While the prototype is complete, there is a lot of work ahead. Currently, it's just a simple script to boot up a full-screen website, but I plan to create an actual bootable ISO and develop my own browser OS.
Perhaps one day this could rival ChromeOS for non-technical users, who knows?

But what inspired me to do this?

I saw posts about Puter.com and Windows 96 and wanted to create something similar myself, taking it a step further by developing a Linux distro that boots directly into my fake operating system. Browsers are a lot like operating systems, so why not give it a try?
