Currently, MacOS uses the coreutils from FreeBSD, which are considered to be "feature complete." However, I believe that macOS would benefit from having a native set of coreutils written in Swift. I am in the process of re-writing them with a permissive license.

Swift is ideal for this task, as its standard library offers numerous built-in file management functions that can be used to recreate the coreutils. Additionally, the source code for the finalized programs is concise and simple to read.

Below is the source code for pwd.swift:

```swift
import Foundation

// Enable FileManager class
let fm = FileManager.default

// Get current working directory
let getWorkingDirectory = fm.currentDirectoryPath

// Print current working directory
print(getWorkingDirectory)
```

The best part is that this Swift code is cross-platform. I tested it on Debian, and it works perfectly. It appears that it doesn't rely on any macOS-specific features, or at least they are well obfuscated.
