I am currently in the process of rewriting the coreutils in Swift. MacOS currently uses coreutils from FreeBSD. It seems that the coreutils were not a top priority and were simply deemed good enough to be left as they are.

Looking at the source code for GNU pwd, you can see how much code goes into creating a GNU core util. The pwd.c file is 400 lines long, not including code from imported headers.

In comparison, the FreeBSD version is much shorter at 123 lines and is fully POSIX compliant.

I won't delve into the OpenBSD coreutils, as they are a different beast altogether with unveil and other OpenBSD-specific features.

Although not all programs are small, in general, Swift was relatively easy to work with.

Below is the source code for pwd.swift:

```swift
import Foundation

// Enable FileManager class
let fm = FileManager.default

// Get current working directory
let getWorkingDirectory = fm.currentDirectoryPath

// Print current working directory
print(getWorkingDirectory)
```

The best part is that this Swift code is cross-platform. I tested it on Debian, and it works perfectly. It appears that it doesn't rely on any macOS-specific features, or at least they are well obfuscated.
