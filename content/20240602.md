It's a rather simple program, but I'm glad I wrote it. For those not in the Unix ricing world, Neofetch is a terminal application that displays system information such as the OS name, kernel version, RAM usage, hardware specs like GPU and CPU. It is often seen in desktop screenshots for the cool factor. Neofetch was itself a clone of Screenfetch.

The Neofetch project has been discontinued for a while now, so I decided to write one for MacOS in Swift for fun.

It really was quite simple since all you're really doing is printing the output of various Unix commands to the screen. Some were MacOS specific, though Swift actually has the ability to seamlessly run a Unix command on your system and store the output of that command in a value. You can then format the output and print it where you want it.
Of course, as is tradition, the app has to have an ASCII art for the OS.
