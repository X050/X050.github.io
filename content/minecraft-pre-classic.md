# The pre-Classic Era (From "Cave Game" to "Minecraft")

The pre-Classic Era refers to the versions of Minecraft from rd-131648 to mc-161648 created between the 13th and 16th of May 2009.

Notch originally wanted to make a clone of Infiniminer and used the source code of one of his earlier games called RubyDung (the "rd-" prefix refers to RubyDung).

Notch posted about his progress in the #LWJGL IRC channel. Some people from that channel also play-tested the game.
