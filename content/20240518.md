Nushire: v20240518
===

I'd like to discuss the version control system I intend to use.

My proposed versioning system involves using a date-based structure for internal builds, as well as a separate system for public releases. For example, an internal build created today might be labeled as Version: v240517, while a public release could be named "v0.0.0a."

Under this system, version numbers will be incremented on a monthly and yearly basis, unless a hotfix is necessary. Regular releases are scheduled monthly, with private builds identified using the date versioning system - so a build from May 17th, 2024 would be marked as v20240517.

Examples:
===

May 17th 2024 == v20240517 (Private)

Jun 1st 2024 == v0.0.1a (Public)

Jul 1st 2024 == v0.0.2a (Public)

May 1st 2025 == v1.0.0 (Public)

Jun 1st 2025 == v1.0.1 (Public)

May 1st 2026 == v1.1.0 (Public)

Jun 1st 2026 == v1.1.1 (Public)
