Nushire: v20240518
===

I'd like to discuss the version control system I intend to use.

I'm thinking of using dates for my internal builds and a different system for when I release stuff to the public. For example, an internal build made today might be called something like Version: v20240517 (based on the date), while a public release could be named "v0.1a".

Public releases would happen on the 1st of every month or two.

When the game is all done and feature complete, I'll release it on Steam (probably on May 17th) as v1.0. Then I'll keep fixing bugs and making the server run better with updates like v1.0.1, v1.0.2, and so on.

Examples:
===

May 17th 2024 == v20240517 (Private)

Apr 1st 2025 == v0.1a (Public)

May 1st 2025 == v0.2a (Public)

May 17th 2026 == v1.0 (Public and feature complete!)

Jun 1st 2026 == v1.0.1 (Public)
