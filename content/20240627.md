So I recently started working on my own static video site generator, inspired by Hugo, the static blog site generator. I wanted to create a project using similar technologies, specifically Golang's html templating system.

It's been a fun project so far, and I've even received a few stars on the GitHub repository. While the generator can currently create an index/home page and individual video pages, it's not yet able to generate both simultaneously for every video. Still, it's a neat proof of concept that I'm excited to continue working on.
